# redwoodjs-stripe

A Redwood/Stripe integration made easy!

This package is being built with the support of the awesome people at [Redwood](https://redwoodjs.com/) and [Stripe](https://stripe.com/)

###  Try it out

There's a very unstable version of the plugin available to try out. It's held together with spit and wishful. It's to give future users a taste of things to come.

**Prerequisites**

A stripe account (preferably in test mode)

[Stripe CLI](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli) installed (if you want to play with webhooks)

**Steps**
1. Create a fresh Redwood app

`yarn create redwood-app myDemo`

`cd myDemo`

2. Install the plugin

`yarn add redwoodjs-stripe`

3. Setup the plugin and follow the prompts

`yarn redwoodjs-stripe setup`

4. Start up your app and then navigate to [localhost:8910/stripe-demo](http://localhost:8910/stripe-demo)

`yarn rw dev`

_The following steps won't be needed for much longer_

5. Checkout a subscription item using "user@test.com" as email.

6. Configure Customer Portal in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/subscriptions) 

7. Play around!

## API Reference

After setting up your app via the CLI, you'll find a demo page has been added to your app. This is intended as an in-app API reference, though in proper store it might a little different. 

### `<StripeProvider/>`

Uses a provider to manage the StripeCart, store customer data and contain logic.

Pass a [querystring](https://stripe.com/docs/search#search-query-language) to `customer.search` to get corresponding Stripe Customer.

**Example 1**

```js
import { StripeProvider } from 'redwoodjs-stripe/web'

// ...

 <StripeProvider
        customer={{
          search: isLoggedIn ? `email: "${emailFromAuth}"` : '',
        }}
      >
        <Storefront/>
  </StripeProvider>
```

**Example 2**

Routes.js
```js
import { StripeProvider } from 'redwoodjs-stripe/web'

// ...

<Set wrap={StripeProvider} customer={{search: isLoggedIn ? `email: "${emailFromAuth}"` : ''}}>
  <Route path="/category" page={CategoryPage} name="category" />
  <Route path="/product" page={ProductPage} name="product" />
  // ...
</Set>
```

### `useStripeCheckout()`

Hook to redirect to Stripe-hosted Checkout. 

Returns a `checkout` function. See the comments in the example below for more information on its usage.

**Example**

```js
import { useStripeCheckout } from 'redwoodjs-stripe/web'
// ...
const checkout = useStripeCheckout()
// ...
onButtonClick = async() => {
  await checkout({
    cart: cart // 'cart' is not required when using built-in cart
    mode: 'recurring' // optional if cart items have 'type' as part their objects, else defaults to 'once-off'
    successUrl:
        'http://localhost:8910/stripe-demo?success=true&sessionId={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}', // Required
    cancelUrl: 'http://localhost:8910/stripe-demo?success=false', // Required
  })
}
```

### `useStripeCart()`

Hook to manage the Stripe Cart. Returns an object with the cart api (described below).

**Example**
```js
import { useStripeCart } from 'redwoodjs-stripe/web'
// ...
const { 
  cart, 
  clearCart, 
  addToCart, 
  removeFromCart, 
  editCartItem
} = useStripeCart()
```

### Cart API

#### `cart`

An array of Product objects. Each `item` has the following shape:

```ts
{
  id: string
  name?: string
  images?: string[]
  description?: string
  price?: number
  type?: string
}
```

Each object _must_ contain an `id`. This `id` corresponds to the StripePrice's `id` when using the generated StripeProductsCell.

When checking out with both recurring and once-off items then `type` needs to be included in the object.

#### `clearCart()`

Removes all items from `cart`.

#### `addToCart(product)`

Adds a `Product` to the `cart`. 

```js
addToCart({
  id: 'price_12345',
  // ...
})
```

#### `removeFromCart(id)`

Removes an item from the `cart` via the item `id`.

```js
removeFromCart('price_12345')
```

#### `editCartItem(id, details)`

Edits the cart item. For example, to change the `quantity`:

```js
editCartItem('price_12345', { quantity: 4 })
```

`details` has the following shape:

```ts
{
  quantity?: number
}
```

### `useStripeCustomerPortal`

### `<StripeProductsCell/>`
