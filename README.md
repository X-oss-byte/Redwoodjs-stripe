# redwoodjs-stripe

A Redwood/Stripe integration made easy!

This plugin enables you to create a commerce site with minimal configuration. After running the setup command you will have a demo storefront generated into your app which uses a simple cart machine for cart items and uses Stripe Checkout to checkout your items. You can either customise the demo store or use it as documentation for building your own storefront.

ðŸš€ Built with help from the awesome people at [Redwood](https://redwoodjs.com/) and [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) ðŸš€
